### DOM

* *document.getElementById(id)* - specifies the html element by 'id' that you want to modify with javascript
* *document.querySelector()* - specifies the html element that you want to modify with javascript
* *.src* - sets the source url of the html element
* *.style.* - styles the html element
* *.innerText* - sets text for an html element
* *.appendChild* - adds an html element to a list
* *.removeChild* - removes an html element from a list

### While Loop
while (condition is true){
    execute this code
}

### For Loop
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3){
    code to be executed
}

* **Statement 1** is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
* **Statement 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.
* **Statement 3** is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
